# Coordinates-Shader
An XYZ Coordinate display primarily made for VRChat, but should work with anything unity related.
As recommended by VRChat, the shader doesn't use any custom keywords not already explicitly allowed.
Shows the XYZ position of the gameobject it is put on. Should be used on a plane if you want it to look nice.
I suggest using the unity package in the release as a base for the best results.

# Unity Package Contains:
-Prefab of example coordinate layout
-Three materials that go to prefab
-Texture containing all the required numbers, as well as extra symbols needed.
-Shader

# Shader:
-CoordsShader By Me!
